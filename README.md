# Fullstack Assessment Submission

This repository contains my submission for the fullstack assessment. The project is structured with separate folders for the frontend and backend implementations to ensure clarity and modularity.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── frontend/    # Contains the frontend application
├── backend/     # Contains the backend application
```

### Frontend
The `frontend` folder contains the implementation of the user interface. It is built using Next.js + MUI (latest version 15.x) with the App Router feature for modern and efficient routing.

#### Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Backend
The `backend` folder contains the server-side implementation. It is designed to provide robust and secure APIs to support the frontend.

#### Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run tests to ensure the setup is correct:
   ```bash
   npm run test
